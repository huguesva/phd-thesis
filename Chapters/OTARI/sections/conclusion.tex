\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we presented a versatile framework to control the value of any OT regulariser in source and target locations. We showed encouraging preliminary results for domain adaptation that will be investigated in upcoming works. One could also extend OTARI to continuous distributions and apply it to OT mapping
estimation \cite{pooladian2021entropic}. Other interesting directions include
investigating optimization algorithms that can avoid quadratic memory complexity.
