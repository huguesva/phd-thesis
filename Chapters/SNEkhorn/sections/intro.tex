\paragraph{Contributions.} In this work, we study the missing
link between EAs, which are easy to tune and adaptable to data with heterogeneous density, and DS affinities which have interesting properties in practical applications as aforementioned. 
%To this end, we tackle two major challenges.
%Extending entropic affinities from stochastic to
%doubly stochastic seems promising given all the aforementioned benefits. 
%However, two main challenges appear. 
% First, the current formulation of entropic affinities is specifically tailored for directed stochastic affinities. Secondly, as pointed out in \citep{lu2019doubly}, when one
% runs t-SNE with a doubly stochastic affinity, low dimensional
% coordinates tend to concentrate on spheres thus making embedding onto a 2D
% surface (typical use case of DR) of limited use \titouan{a reformuler ces deux phrases: la deuxieme est effectivement un challenge mais je ne comprends pas en quoi ce qu'on fait le résoud, et le premier c'est pas vraiment un challenge, c'est juste que ça n'existe pas}\nc{agree with that}.  
Our main contributions are as follows. We uncover the convex
optimization problem that underpins classical entropic affinities, exhibiting
novel links with entropy-regularized Optimal Transport (OT) (\cref{sec:entropic_affinity_semi_relaxed}). We then propose in \cref{subsec:sea} a principled symmetrization of entropic
affinities. The latter enables controlling the entropy in each point, unlike
t-SNE's post-processing symmetrization, and producing a genuinely doubly stochastic affinity. We show how to
compute this new affinity efficiently using a dual ascent algorithm.
In \cref{sec:DR_with_OT}, we introduce SNEkhorn: a DR algorithm that couples this new symmetric entropic affinity with a doubly stochastic kernel in the low-dimensional embedding space, without sphere concentration issue \cite{lu2019doubly}. We finally showcase the benefits of symmetric entropic affinities on a variety of applications in Section \ref{sec:DR_experiments} including spectral clustering and DR experiments on datasets ranging from images to genomics data.
