\section{PCA as Graph Coupling}

As we argue that the inability of SNE-like methods to reproduce the coarse-grain dependencies of the input in the latent space is due to the degeneracy of the conditional (\ref{eq:proba_perp}), a natural solution would be to consider graphical models that are well defined and integrable on the entire definition spaces of $\Xb$ and $\Zb$. For simplicity, we consider the Gaussian model and leave the extension to other kernels for future works. Note that in this case, integrability translates into the precision matrix being full-rank. As we see with the following, the natural extension of our framework to such models leads to a well-established PCA algorithm. In the following, for a continuous variable $\bm{\Theta}_{Z}$, $\mathbb{P}(\bm{\Theta}_{Z} = \cdot)$ denotes its density.


\begin{restatable}{theorem}{PCAgraphcoupling}
\label{PCA_graph_coupling}
Let $\nu \geq n$,  $\bm{\Theta}_{X} \sim \mathcal{W}(\nu, \bm{I}_n)$ and $\bm{\Theta}_{Z} \sim \mathcal{W}(\nu + p - q, \bm{I}_n)$. Assume that $\bm{\Theta}_{X}$ and $\bm{\Theta}_{Z}$ structure the rows of respectively $\Xb$ and $\Zb$ such that: 
\begin{align}
    \mathrm{vec}(\Xb) | \bm{\Theta}_{X} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{0}, \bm{\Theta}_{X}^{-1} \otimes \bm{I}_p), \label{eq:X_given_theta} \\
    \mathrm{vec}(\Zb) | \bm{\Theta}_{Z} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{0}, \bm{\Theta}_{Z}^{-1} \otimes \bm{I}_q) \label{eq:Z_given_theta} \:.
\end{align}
Then the solution to the precision coupling problem:
\begin{align*}
    \min_{\Zb \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times q}} -\mathbb{E}_{\bm{\Theta}_{X} | \Xb}\left[\log \mathbb{P}(\bm{\Theta}_{Z}=\bm{\Theta}_{X}|\Zb)\right]
\end{align*}
is a PCA embedding of $\Xb$ with $q$ components.
\end{restatable}

We now highlight the parallels with the previous construction done for neighbor embedding methods. First note that the multivariate Gaussian with full-rank precision is inherently a pairwise MRF \citep{rue2005gaussian}. When choosing the Gaussian kernel for neighbor embedding methods, we saw that the graph Laplacian $\bm{L}_{X}$ of $\Wb_{X}$ was playing the role of the among-row precision matrix, as we had $\Xb | \Wb_{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{0}, \bm{L}_{X}^{-1} \otimes \bm{I}_p)$ (equation \ref{eq:gaussian_kernel}). Recall that the latter always has a null space which is spanned by the CC indicator vectors of $\Wb$ (\cref{sec:laplacian_prop}). Here, the key difference is that we impose a full-rank constraint on the precision $\bm{\Theta}$. Concerning the priors, we choose the ones that are conjugate to the conditionals (\ref{eq:X_given_theta}) and (\ref{eq:Z_given_theta}), as previously done when constructing the prior for neighbor embedding methods (definition \ref{def:prior_W}). Hence in the full-rank setting, the prior simply amounts to a Wishart distribution denoted by $\mathcal{W}$.

The above theorem further highlights the flexibility and generality of the graph coupling framework. Unlike usual constructions of PCA or probabilistic PCA \citep{tipping1999probabilistic}, in the above the linear relation between $\Xb$ and $\Zb$ is recovered by solving the graph coupling problem and not explicitly stated beforehand. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time such a link has been uncovered between PCA and SNE-like methods. In contrast with the latter, PCA is well-known for its ability to preserve global structure while being significantly less efficient at identifying clusters \citep{anowar2021conceptual}. Therefore, as suspected in \cref{sec:interpretations}, the degeneracy of the conditional distribution given the graph is key to determining the distance preservation properties of the embeddings. We propose in \cref{sec:hierarchical_modelling} to combine both graph coupling approaches to strike a balance between global and local structure preservation.

\section {Shift-Invariant Pairwise MRF to Model Row Dependencies} \label{sec:graph_structure}

We start by defining the distribution of the observations given a graph. The latter takes the form of a pairwise MRF model which as we show is improper (\textit{i.e.}\ not integrable on $\mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$) when shift-invariant kernels are used. We consider a fixed directed graph $\Wb \in \mathcal{S}_{W}$ where:
$$\mathcal{S}_{W} = \left\{\Wb \in \mathbb{N}^{n \times n} \mid \forall (i,j) \in \integ{n}^2, W_{ii}=0, W_{ij} \leq n \right\}$$
Throughout, $(E, \mathcal{B}(E), \lambda_E)$ denotes a measure space where $\mathcal{B}(E)$ is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $E$ and $\lambda_E$ is the Lebesgue measure on $E$.

\subsection{Graph Laplacian Null Space}\label{sec:laplacian_prop}
A central element in our construction is the graph Laplacian linear map, defined as follows, where $\mathcal{S}^n_+(\mathbb{R})$ is the set of positive semidefinite matrices.
\begin{definition}\label{graph_laplacian}
The graph Laplacian operator is the map $L \colon \mathbb{R}_+^{n \times n} \cap \mathcal{S}^n(\R) \to \mathcal{S}^n_+(\mathbb{R})$ such that
$$\text{for } (i,j) \in \integ{n}^2, \quad L(\Wb)_{ij} = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
    - W_{ij} & \text{if } i \neq j \\
    \sum_{k \in \integ{n}} W_{ik} & \text{otherwise} \:.
\end{array} 
\right. $$
\end{definition}
With an abuse of notation, let $\Lb = L(\overline{\Wb})$ where $\overline{\Wb} = \Wb + \Wb^\top$. Let $(C_1,...,C_{R})$ be a partition of $\integ{n}$ (\textit{i.e.}\ the set $\{1,2,...,n\}$) corresponding to the connected components (CCs) of $\overline{\Wb}$. As well known in spectral graph theory \citep{Chung97}, the null space of $\Lb$ is spanned by the orthonormal vectors $\{\Ub_{r}\}_{r \in [R]}$ such that for $r \in [R]$,
$\Ub_{r} = \left(n_r^{-1/2} \ind_{i \in C_r}\right)_{i \in \integ{n}}$ with $n_r = \operatorname{Card}(C_r)$. By the spectral theorem, $\Ub_{[R]}$ can be completed such that $\Lb = \bm{U \Lambda U^\top}$ where $\Ub = (\Ub_1, ..., \Ub_n)$ is orthogonal and $\bm{\Lambda} = \operatorname{diag}((\lambda_i)_{i \in \integ{n}})$ with $0 = \lambda_1 = ... = \lambda_R < \lambda_{R+1} \leq ... \leq \lambda_n$. 

In what follows, the data is split into two parts: $\Xb_{M}$, the orthogonal projection of $\Xb$ on $\mathcal{S}_{M} = (\ker \Lb) \otimes \mathbb{R}^p$, and $\Xb_{C}$, the projection on $\mathcal{S}_{C} = (\ker \Lb)^{\perp} \otimes \mathbb{R}^p$. For $i \in \integ{n}$, $\Xb_{M,i} = \sum_{r \in [R]} n_r^{-1} \ind_{i \in C_r}\sum_{\ell \in C_r} \Xb_{\ell} $ hence $\Xb_{M}$ stands for the empirical means of $\Xb$ on CCs, thus modelling the CC positions, while $\Xb_{C} = \Xb - \Xb_{M}$ is CC-wise centered, thus modeling the relative positions of the nodes within CCs. We now introduce the probability distribution of these variables.

\subsection{Pairwise MRF and Shift-Invariances}\label{sec:within_CC}

In this work, the dependency structure among rows of the data is governed by a graph. The strength of the connection between two nodes is given by a symmetric function $k: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}_+$ \hva{reformuler symmetric}. We consider the following pairwise MRF unnormalized density function:
\begin{align}\label{eq:unnormalized_MRF}
  f_{k} \colon (\Xb,\Wb) &\mapsto \prod_{(i,j) \in \integ{n}^2} k(\mathbf{x}_{i} - \mathbf{x}_{j})^{W_{ij}} \: .
\end{align}
As we will see shortly, the above is at the heart of DR methods based on pairwise similarities. Note that as $k$ measures the similarity between couples of samples, $f_k$ will take high values if the rows of $\Xb$ vary smoothly on the graph $\Wb$. Thus we can expect $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{x}_j$ to be close if there is an edge between node $i$ and node $j$ in $\Wb$. A key remark is that $f_{k}$ is kept invariant by translating $\Xb_{M}$. Namely for all $\Xb \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$, $f_{k}(\Xb, \Wb) = f_{k}(\Xb_{C}, \Wb)$. This invariance results in $f_{k}(\cdot, \Wb)$ being non integrable on $\mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$, as we see with the following example. 

\paragraph{Gaussian kernel.} For a positive definite matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathcal{S}^n_{++}(\mathbb{R})$, consider the Gaussian kernel $k : \Xb \mapsto e^{- \frac{1}{2}\| \Xb \|_{\mathbf{\Sigma}}^2}$ where $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ stands for the covariance among columns. One has:
\begin{align}\label{eq:gaussian_kernel}
    \log f_{k}(\Xb, \Wb) &= -\sum_{(i,j) \in \integ{n}^2} W_{ij} \| \mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{j} \|^2_{\mathbf{\Sigma}}
    = - \operatorname{tr} \left(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \Xb^{T} \Lb \Xb\right)
\end{align}
by property of the graph Laplacian (\cref{graph_laplacian}). In this case, it is clear that due to the rank deficiency of $\Lb$, $f_{k}(\cdot, \Wb)$ is only $\lambda_{\mathcal{S}_{C}}$-integrable. In general DR settings one does not want to rely on Gaussian kernels only. A striking example is the use of the Student kernel in t-SNE \citep{maaten2008tSNE}. Heavy-tailed kernels appear useful when the dimension of the embeddings is smaller than the intrinsic dimension of the data \citep{kobak2019heavy}. Our contribution provides flexibility by extending the previous result to a large class of kernels, as stated in the following theorem.

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{integrabilitypairwiseMRF}
\label{prop:integrability_pairwise_MRF}
If $k$ is $\lambda_{\mathbb{R}^p}$-integrable and bounded above $\lambda_{\mathbb{R}^p}$-almost everywhere then $f_{k}(\cdot, \Wb)$ is $\lambda_{\mathcal{S}_{C}}$-integrable.
\end{restatable}

We refer to \cref{proof:lambda_perp_integrability} for the proof.
We can now define a distribution on $(\mathcal{S}_{C}, \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S}_{C}))$, where $\mathcal{C}_{k}(\Wb) = \int f_{k}(\cdot, \Wb) d\lambda_{\mathcal{S}_{C}}$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:proba_perp}
\mathbb{P}_{k}(d\Xb_{C} | \Wb) = \mathcal{C}_{k}(\Wb)^{-1} f_{k}(\Xb_{C}, \Wb) \lambda_{\mathcal{S}_{C}}(d\Xb_{C}) \: .
\end{align}

\begin{remark}
Kernels may have node-specific bandwidths $\bm{\tau}$, set during a pre-processing step, giving $f_{k}(\Xb,\Wb) = \prod_{(i,j)} k((\mathbf{x}_{i} - \mathbf{x}_{j})/\tau_{i})^{W_{ij}}$. Note that such bandwidth does not affect the degeneracy of the distribution and \cref{prop:integrability_pairwise_MRF} still holds.
\end{remark}


\paragraph{Between-Rows Dependency Structure.} By symmetry of $k$, reindexing gives: $f_{k}(\Xb, \Wb) = \prod_{j \in \integ{n}} \prod_{i \in [j]} k(\mathbf{x}_{i} - \mathbf{x}_{j})^{\overline{W}_{ij}}$. Hence distribution \eqref{eq:proba_perp} boils down to a pairwise MRF model \citep{clifford1990markov} with respect to the undirected graph $\overline{\Wb}$, $\mathcal{C}_{k}$ playing the role of the partition function. Note that since $f_k$ (Equation \ref{eq:unnormalized_MRF}) trivially factorize according to the cliques of $\overline{\Wb}$, the Hammersley-Clifford theorem ensures that the rows of $\Xb_{C}$ satisfy the local and global Markov properties with respect to $\overline{\Wb}$. 

\subsection{Uninformative Model for CC-wise Means}

We showed that the MRF (\ref{eq:unnormalized_MRF}) is only integrable on $\mathcal{S}_{C}$, the definition of which depends on the connectivity structure of $\Wb$. As we now demonstrate, the latter MRF can be seen as a limit of proper distributions on $\mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$, see \textit{e.g.}\ \cite{rue2005gaussian} for a similar construction in the Gaussian case. 
We introduce the Borel function $f^{\varepsilon}(\cdot, \Wb) \colon \mathbb{R}^{n \times p} \to \mathbb{R}_+$ for $\varepsilon > 0$ such that for all $\Xb \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$, $f^{\varepsilon}(\Xb, \Wb) = f^{\varepsilon}(\Xb_{M}, \Wb)$. To allow $f^{\varepsilon}$ to become arbitrarily non-informative, we assume that for all $\Wb \in \mathcal{S}_{W}$, $f^\varepsilon(\cdot, \Wb)$ is $\lambda_{\mathcal{S}_{M}}$-integrable for all $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}^*_+$ and $f^{\varepsilon}(\cdot, \Wb) \xrightarrow[\varepsilon \to 0]{} 1$ almost everywhere.
We now define the conditional distribution on $(\mathcal{S}_{M}, \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S}_{M}))$ as follows:
\begin{align}\label{eq:proba_parallel}
     \mathbb{P}^{\varepsilon}(d\Xb_{M}| \Wb) = \mathcal{C}^{\varepsilon}(\Wb)^{-1} f^{\varepsilon}(\Xb_{M}, \Wb) \lambda_{\mathcal{S}_{M}}(d\Xb_{M})
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{C}^{\varepsilon}(\Wb) = \int f^{\varepsilon}(\cdot, \Wb) d\lambda_{\mathcal{S}_{M}}$.
With this at hand, the joint conditional is defined as the product measure of (\ref{eq:proba_perp}) and (\ref{eq:proba_parallel}) over the row axis, the integrability of which is ensured by the Fubini-Tonelli theorem. In the following we will use the compact notation $\mathcal{C}^{\varepsilon}_k(\Wb) = \mathcal{C}_k(\Wb)\mathcal{C}^{\varepsilon}(\Wb)$ for the joint normalizing constant.

\begin{remark}
At the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ the above construction amounts to setting an infinite variance on the distribution of the empirical means of $\Xb$ on CCs, thus losing the inter-CC structure. 
\end{remark}

As an illustration, one can structure the CCs' relative positions according to a Gaussian model with positive definite precision $\varepsilon \bm{\Theta} \in \mathcal{S}_{++}^R(\mathbb{R})$, as it amounts to choosing $f^{\varepsilon} : \Xb \to \exp \left(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2} \operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\Xb^\top\Ub_{[:R]}  \bm{\Theta}\Ub^\top_{[:R]} \Xb\right)\right)$ such that: $\mathrm{vec}(\Xb_{M}) | \bm{\Theta} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\bm{0}, \left(\varepsilon \Ub_{[:R]}  \bm{\Theta}\Ub^\top_{[:R]}\right)^{-1} \otimes \mathbf{\Sigma}\right)$ where $\otimes$ denotes the Kronecker product.
